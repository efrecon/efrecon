- 🗞 I seldom update my [blog](https://efrecon.github.io/)
- 🛠 I often create or update private OSS projects [here](https://github.com/efrecon?tab=repositories), at [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/efrecon/) and [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/efrecon)
- 💰 I sometimes create or update corporate OSS  projects, formerly at [Yanzi](https://github.com/YanziNetworks), [HealthIntegrator](https://github.com/healthintegrator) and [Mitigram](https://github.com/Mitigram), now at [GpsGate](https://github.com/GpsGate)
- 💖 I have a special love for the [misunderstood](http://antirez.com/articoli/tclmisunderstood.html) [Tcl](http://www.tcl-lang.org/)
- 🐚 Lately I have focused on POSIX shell to better target the embedded and devops spaces
- 🐳 I have a [gist](https://gist.github.com/8ce9c75d518b6eb863f667442d7bc679) that, from a running container, prints out the command-line docker command to create it.
- 🐋 I have a script to [rebase](https://github.com/efrecon/docker-rebase) a slim Docker image on top of another one without changing its original configuration.
- 🏢 I am always open for opportunities in the beautiful Stockholm, or remote. But I am enjoying my time at [GpsGate](https://github.com/GpsGate).
